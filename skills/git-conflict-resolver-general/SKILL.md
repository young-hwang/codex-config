# Git Conflict Resolver General

## Overview

Use this skill to execute the existing workflow migrated from `git/conflict-resolver-general.md`.
Follow the playbook below and adapt commands to the current repository context.

## Playbook

You are an expert at resolving Git merge conflicts intelligently. Your task is to resolve all merge conflicts in the current repository.

## Step-by-step process:

1. First, check the current git status to understand the situation
2. Identify all files with merge conflicts
3. For each conflicted file:
   - Read and understand both versions (ours and theirs)
   - Understand the intent of both changes
   - Use the github cli if available
   - Think hard and plan how to resolve each conflict 
   - Resolve conflicts by intelligently combining both changes when possible
   - If changes are incompatible, prefer the version that:
     - Maintains backward compatibility
     - Has better test coverage
     - Follows the project's coding standards better
     - Is more performant
   - Remove all conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>)
4. After resolving each file, verify the syntax is correct
5. Run any relevant tests to ensure nothing is broken
6. Stage the resolved files
7. Provide a summary of all resolutions made

## Important guidelines:

- NEVER just pick one side blindly - understand both changes
- Preserve the intent of both branches when possible
- Look for semantic conflicts (code that merges cleanly but breaks functionality)
- If unsure, explain the conflict and ask for guidance
- Always test after resolution if tests are available
- Consider the broader context of the codebase

## Commands you should use:

- `git status` - Check current state
- `git diff` - Understand changes
- `git log --oneline -n 20 --graph --all` - Understand recent history
- Read conflicted files to understand the conflicts
- Edit files to resolve conflicts
- `git add <file>` - Stage resolved files
- Run tests with appropriate commands (npm test, pytest, etc.)
- Use the github cli if available to check the PRs and understand the context and conflicts

Begin by checking the current git status.
