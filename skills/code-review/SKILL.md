# Code Review

## Overview

Use this skill to execute the existing workflow migrated from `code-review.md`.
Follow the playbook below and adapt commands to the current repository context.

## Playbook

# Code Review

Comprehensive security and quality review of uncommitted changes:

1. Get changed files: git diff --name-only HEAD

2. For each changed file, check for:

**Security Issues (CRITICAL):**
- Hardcoded credentials, API keys, tokens
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS vulnerabilities  
- Missing input validation
- Insecure dependencies
- Path traversal risks

**Code Quality (HIGH):**
- Functions > 50 lines
- Files > 800 lines
- Nesting depth > 4 levels
- Missing error handling
- console.log statements
- TODO/FIXME comments
- Missing JSDoc for public APIs

**Best Practices (MEDIUM):**
- Mutation patterns (use immutable instead)
- Emoji usage in code/comments
- Missing tests for new code
- Accessibility issues (a11y)

3. Generate report with:
   - Severity: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
   - File location and line numbers
   - Issue description
   - Suggested fix

4. Block commit if CRITICAL or HIGH issues found

Never approve code with security vulnerabilities!
